## 🦾 Getting Started
You have to have Flutter installed on your machine. I built this application with `Flutter version, 3.22.3` and `Dart version 3.4.4` on my local machine. 

To run this project clone this repository. Launch your favourite Flutter IDE and run on your terminal at the project folder location `flutter pub get` to get dependencies (This assumes you already have Flutter installed on your machine). 

Once you're done, you can then proceed to running the application. I personally use VScode but you can run this in IntelliJ or Android Studio.

## 🛠 How to use
The app is pretty straight forward, you're greeted with the passcode screen. Inputing any passcode (any 6 digts) grants you access, you can then proceed to the home screen.
